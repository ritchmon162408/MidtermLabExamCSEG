# Pathfinding Algorithms in Python

This project implements and compares two pathfinding algorithms: Greedy Best-First Search and A* Search, using a grid with obstacles.

## Files

- **main.py**: The main script to run the algorithms and compare results.
- **algorithms.py**: Contains the Greedy Best-First Search and A* Search algorithm implementations.
- **grid.py**: Defines the grid, start, and goal locations, along with the heuristic function.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run `main.py` using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python main.py
